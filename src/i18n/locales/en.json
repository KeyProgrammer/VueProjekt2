We increase conversion through activities consisting of: Analysing user behaviour based on analytical tools (e.g. Abee Cloud, IBM Tealeaf, others)AB testing based on the Abee Cloud platform Auditing of sites and consulting by experts with many years of experience in eCommerce. A key element is data. We are able to collect and analyse it using Abee Cloud, thus feeding our models, or in the case of many clients where the data is highly sensitive, feeding the client-side BI systems. The analysis results in recommendations supported by empirical data, which we implement immediately.</p> <h1>Abee TST</h1> <p>A/B tests<br> Our company offers the Abee TST tool, which allows you to carry out advanced A/B tests for your website.

        "howWeWorkDescription": "<h1>How do we work?</h1><h2>Fix Agile</h2><p>Fix Agile is a set of practices developed at KeyProgrammers since 2020 based on collaboration with clients. The methodology was first used in 2020 for a client in the Public sector.</p><h2>The methodology consists of 4 phases:</h2><ul><li><b>Idea</b> - defining the direction of actions and the business goal at a strategic level (e.g., 20% sales in the eCommerce channel). At a high level, the project budget should be estimated.</li><li><b>Initiation</b> - translating the strategic goal into actions. Decomposing the goal into sprints and revising budget assumptions. Based on our experience, the estimation accuracy at this stage can be up to +/-5%.</li><li><b>Execution</b> - dividing the project into 2-4-week sprints depending on the project's scale. Each sprint has a clearly defined scope guaranteed for delivery (DoD - definition of done) for each task. Each sprint concludes with a review. Only completed tasks undergo review.</li><li><b>Support</b> - during the project, completed elements of the solution are supported by the Project Team within ongoing work (CAPEX). After the project is completed, work is carried out according to the SLA.</li></ul><h3>Characteristics of Fix Agile:</h3><ul><li>Guaranteed completion of work</li><li>Optimal team management through matching the necessary competencies to achieve the goal</li><li>Ensuring project fluidity</li><li>Work acceptance after each sprint</li><li>Work can start even when the scope is not precisely defined</li><li>Orders can involve a pool of MD for work execution</li><li>Contract provisions ensure the right to use the developed products</li><li>Project interruption is possible at any stage</li></ul><h3>Main benefits for the Client:</h3><ul><li><b>Adaptation to business needs</b></li>Achieving the goal through working in short sprints with clear results at the end of each one.<li><b>Guarantees and accountability</b></li>Unlike Time&Material work, the Supplier takes full responsibility for the completed work and provides contractual guarantees.<li><b>Work acceptance</b></li>Only completed and approved work is subject to acceptance by the Client during the Sprint Review.<li><b>Flexibility and T2M</b></li>The project starts with an analytical phase. Defining requirements together allows for adjusting technical capabilities to business needs.<li><b>Know-how and supplier potential</b></li>Access to knowledge and the supplier's potential is the same as in Fix Price - the Supplier executes the project, not individual individuals from the supplier.<li><b>Team capacity management</b></li>Teams can be scaled up and down based on needs and the flow of requirements. Any absences and personnel fluctuation management are the responsibility of the supplier.</ul><h2>BeeTeaFlow</h2>This is a process model focused on improving the efficiency and quality of service. The main goal of this solution is to increase website conversion rates by utilizing professional web analytics tools.<h3>BeeTeaFlow consists of 4 steps:</h3><ul><li>Web Analytics - In-depth research sessions: understanding user behavior and issues when using the website</li><li>UX Design - Designing user-friendly processes and optimizing the purchase path</li><li>A/B Testing performed on the Abee TST platform.
